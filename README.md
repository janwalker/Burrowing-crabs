# Burrowing-crabs
This is the collective data for Dr. Janet Walker's work on the effect of burrowing crabs on the salt marsh plant community.

The repository includes data used in the analyses for -

The first group of data files include data collected from 2016 to 2019 at six sites - 
  1) KF1 - Kendall-Frost 1
  2) KF2 - Kendall-Frost 2
  3) SDL - San Dieguito Lagoon
  4) BOL - Bolinas Lagoon
  5) TOM - Tomales Bay
  6) BOD - Bodega Bay

All data files note the Year, Month, Day, Marsh, Zone, Cage, and Treatment - 
  1) Year - 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019
  2) Month - January - December
  3) Day - 1-31
  4) Marsh - KF1, KF2, SDL, BOL, TOM, BOD
  5) Zone - reg, hi, lo, mid [only zones reg and mid were used in the above publications]
  6) Cage - replicate number
  7) Treatment - no (no crabs), ambient (ambient levels of crabs), high (high crab densities), ncc (no-cage controls), cc (cage-controls)

X files are the data collected in the manipulation of burrowing crabs from 2016 to 2019 in the above publications

1) Cage_Burrows_Data_NS - Burrows: Total number of burrows counted in each plots; Pachy, Hemi, Fiddler, Green: The number of crabs sighted for each species in each plot; Pitfall: Total number of crabs caught in the pitfall traps; Pitfall-F, Pitfall-P, Pitfall-G, Pitfall-H: The number of crabs caught in pitfall traps for each species
